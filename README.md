# Surfs Up: Oahu Climate Data Analysis

## Background & Purpose

In order to secure investor funding for a Surf & Shake shop (selling surfing equipment and apparel, as well as ice cream and milkshakes) in Oahu, Hawaii, the prospective shop owner analyzed climate data to demonstrate that the local weather patterns would enable such a venture. This analysis is specifically focused on determining if the temperatures in Oahu in June and December are adequately high to support year-round operations.

## Results

In general, temperatures in June are slightly higher than in December.

- The mean temperature in Oahu in June is 74.9 F, compared to 71.0 F in December (3.9 degree differential)
- The maximum temperature in June was 85.0 F, compared to 83.0 F in December (2.0 degree differential)
- The minimum temperature in June was 64.0 F, compared to 56.0 F in December (8.0 degree differential)

## Summary

It appears that the temperatures in Oahu are adequate to support the shop year-round, but more analysis is needed. In particular, it would be useful to understand how climate temperature corresponds with water temperature in the area, as well as surfing behaviors of locals.
